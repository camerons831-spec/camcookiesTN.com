SETUP (IMPORTANT)

This site includes a REAL checkout UI, but payments require account setup.

1) STRIPE (Apple Pay, Debit Cards, Banks, Cash App Pay)
   - Create a Stripe account
   - Enable Apple Pay & Cash App Pay
   - Add your bank for payouts
   - Use Stripe Payment Element or Checkout with your API keys

2) PAYPAL (PayPal + Venmo)
   - Create a PayPal Business account
   - Enable Venmo in settings
   - Add PayPal JS SDK with your client ID

3) TRUST / SECURITY
   - SSL (HTTPS) required (free on most hosts)
   - Stripe & PayPal are PCI compliant

Once connected, funds will hit your account automatically based on provider payout times.
